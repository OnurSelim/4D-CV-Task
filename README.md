# 4D-CV-Task

This is my solution to the Pose Estimation task. I have used MATLAB to solve the problem.

I have used the 2D-3D correspondences to estimate the intrinsic camera matrix. The details are presented in the live script.

To see the steps, one can go through the live script "StructureFromMotionFromMultipleViewsExample.mlx".
